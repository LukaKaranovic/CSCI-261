**Algorithm:**
carry<sub>0</sub> = 0  
For i = 0 to N-1  
1. sum<sub>i</sub> = (x<sub>i</sub> + y<sub>i</sub> + carry<sub>i</sub>) % 2  
2. carry<sub>i+1</sub> = (x<sub>i</sub> + y<sub>i</sub> + carry<sub>i</sub>) / 2
### Carry
When two unsigned integers are added, a carry event takes place if the  
result is larger than the maximum representable unsigned integer (i.e.,  
2<sup>n</sup> - 1). 

While we can’t always prevent carry, we can always detect.

### Two's Complement Addition
Perform additional as usual, it just works
A + (-B)

**Example:** 
5 - 7 -> 5 + (-7)
5 = 0011
-7 = 1001

   0011
\+ 1001
= 1100
which is -2 in decimal.

Advantage of Two's Complement Arithmetic is that both addition and subtraction can be done in one circuit.
## Binary Subtraction
Binary subtraction is performed as same way as decimal.  

Borrow is dependent on the base. In decimal, you borrow a 10’s value from  
the adjoining digit, however, in binary you borrow a (10)<sub>2</sub> which is (2)<sub>10</sub>  

**Subtraction table (in base 2):**
* 1 - 0 = 1 (No Borrow)  
* 1 - 1 = 0 (No Borrow)  
* 0 - 0 = 0 (No Borrow)  
* 10 - 1 = 01 (Borrow from 2’s position)
### Borrow
When two unsigned integers are subtracted, an borrow event occurs if the result  
is negative, smaller than the smallest expressible unsigned integer (i.e., 0).

When borrow occurs, carry flag is set to 0. 
Carry flag = 1 means **no borrow occurred.**

### Two's Complement Subtraction
Idea is that A - B = A + (-B)
1. Get two's complement of B
2. Add the two numbers

**Example:** 
5 - 7 
5 = 0011
-7 = 1001

   0011
\+ 1001
= 1100
which is -2 in decimal.

Advantage of Two's Complement Arithmetic is that both addition and subtraction can be done in one circuit.
## Overflow

### For two's complement addition
Rule for detecting signed two’s complement overflow: 
* When the “carry in” and the “carry out” of the sign bit differ, overflow has occurred. 
* If the carry into the sign bit equals the carry out of the sign bit, no overflow has occurred.

Overflow occurs when the result produced by an arithmetic operation falls  
outside the representable range \[-2<sup>n-1</sup>, 2<sup>n-1</sup> - 1] of two's complement.  

When adding signed numbers, overflow occurs only in two scenarios:  
* Adding two positive numbers produces a non-positive result,  
* Adding two negative numbers yields a non-negative result.

Overflow cannot occur when operands with different signs are added.
### For two's complement subtraction
Overflow occurs when the result produced by an arithmetic operation falls  
outside the representable range \[-2<sup>n-1</sup>, 2<sup>n-1</sup> - 1] of two's complement.

When subtracting signed numbers, overflow occurs in two scenarios:  
* Subtracting a positive number from a negative one creates a positive result,  
* Subtracting a negative number from a positive one makes a negative result.  

Overflow cannot occur when operands with the same sign are subtracted.
