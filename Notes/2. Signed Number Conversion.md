## Signed decimal to binary
### Signed Magnitude
If positive, convert to binary normally, but make the MSB a 0.

If negative, convert to binary normally, but make the MSB a 1.

**Examples:**
(52)<sub>10</sub> -> (0110100)<sub>2</sub>
(-52)<sub>10</sub> -> (1110100)<sub>2</sub>
(127)<sub>10</sub> ->  (01111111)<sub>2</sub>
(-256)<sub>10</sub> -> (1100000000)<sub>2</sub>
### One's Complement
If positive. convert to binary, make sure MSB is 0.

If negative, find the absolute value (positive) first, then flip all 0s and 1s.

**Examples:**
(52)<sub>10</sub> -> (0110100)<sub>2</sub>
(-52)<sub>10</sub> -> (1001011)<sub>2</sub>
(127)<sub>10</sub> ->  (01111111)<sub>2</sub>
(-256)<sub>10</sub> -> (1011111111)<sub>2</sub>
### Two's Complement
If positive. convert to binary, make sure MSB is 0.

If negative, find the absolute value (positive) first, then flip all 0s and 1s, and add 1 in binary after.
* A cool shortcut is to start from the right, copy until the first 1, then flip all 0s and 1s.

**Examples:**
(52)<sub>10</sub> -> (0110100)<sub>2</sub>
(-52)<sub>10</sub> -> (1001100)<sub>2</sub>
(127)<sub>10</sub> ->  (01111111)<sub>2</sub>
(-256)<sub>10</sub> -> (1100000000)<sub>2</sub>
## Signed binary to decimal
To represent signed integers, computer systems allocate the high-order bit to  
indicate the sign of a number.  
* The high-order bit is the leftmost bit. It is also called the most significant bit (MSB).  
* 0 is used to indicate a positive number; 1 indicates a negative number.
### Signed Magnitude
If MSB is 0, it is positive.
If MSB is 1, it is negative.

Convert the rest of the bits to decimal normally as if it were a positive number.

**Examples:**
(0 110100)<sub>2</sub> -> (52)<sub>10</sub> 
(1 110100)<sub>2</sub> -> (-52)<sub>10</sub> 
(0 1111111)<sub>2</sub> -> (127)<sub>10</sub>
(1 100000000)<sub>2</sub> -> (-256)<sub>10</sub>
### One's Complement
If MSB is 0, it is positive.
If MSB is 1, it is negative.

If positive. convert to decimal normally.
If negative, flip all the 1s and 0s, convert to decimal, then multiply by -1 (to make negative).

**Examples:**
(0110100)<sub>2</sub> -> (52)<sub>10</sub>
(1001011)<sub>2</sub> -> (0110100)<sub>2</sub>  -> (52 * -1)<sub>10</sub>  -> (-52)<sub>10</sub> 
(01111111)<sub>2</sub> -> (127)<sub>10</sub>
(1011111111)<sub>2</sub> -> (0100000000)<sub>2</sub>  -> (256 * -1)<sub>10</sub> -> (-256)<sub>10</sub>
### Two's Complement
If MSB is 0, it is positive.
If MSB is 1, it is negative.

If positive. convert to decimal normally.
If negative, copy from right until the first 1, flip all the 0s and 1s, convert to decimal, then multiply by -1 (to make negative).
* Or you can do -1 * 2<sup>n</sup> where n is the power at the MSB, and then calc positive number of the remaining bits and add the two.

**Examples:**
(0110100)<sub>2</sub> -> (52)<sub>10</sub>
(1001100)<sub>2</sub> -> (0110100)<sub>2</sub>  -> (52 * -1)<sub>10</sub>  -> (-52)<sub>10</sub> 
(01111111)<sub>2</sub> -> (127)<sub>10</sub>
(1100000000)<sub>2</sub> -> (0100000000)<sub>2</sub>  -> (256 * -1)<sub>10</sub> -> (-256)<sub>10</sub>
