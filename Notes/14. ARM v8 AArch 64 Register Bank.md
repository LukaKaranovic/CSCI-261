## Learning Objective(s):
The role of:
* Stack pointer/ Zero Register  
* R0-R7  
* R8  
* R9-R18  
* R19-R28  
* R29 - Frame pointer  
* R30 - Link Register  
* PSTATE  
* PC - Program Counter

## Stack Pointer/Zero Register
The stack pointer, sp, is used to hold the address of where the stack ends.
* Commonly referred to as the top of the stack.
* the address where the stack ends may change when registers are pushed onto the stack, or when temporary local variables are allocated/deleted.
* Stack pointer can only be modified or read by a small set of instructions.

The zero register, zr, can be referred to as 64-bit (xzr), or 32-bit (wzr).
* Always has the value zero.
* Most instructions can use the zero register as an operand, even as a destination register. 
	* If this is the case, instruction will not change the destination register.
* The zero register cannot always be used as an operand, as it shares the same binary encoding with the stack pointer, which is the value 31.

**Some instructions can access the zero register, while others can access the stack pointer.**
## R0 - R7
Argument Registers:
* Used to pass argument values into a subroutine and to return a result value from a function.
* They may also be used to hold intermediate values within a routine.
* Caller assumes they will be modified.

These registers are used as parameters and result registers (R0 - R7 in order).
* R0 is first param, R1 is second param, R0 is first return.
They get changed and therefore corrupted after function calls.
## R8
Also known as XR:, the **indirect result** location parameter (corruptible).
* Used to pass the address location of an indirect result, for example, where a function returns a large structure.
## R9 - R18
Caller-Saved Registers (corruptible)
* Caller requires the values in any of these registers to be preserved across a call to another function, the caller must save the affected registers in its own stack frame.
## R19 - R28
Callee-Saved Registers 
* When a function (callee) is called, it is responsible for preserving the values of these registers if it uses them.
* The calling function (caller) can expect that the values in these registers will remain unchanged after the function call.
## R29 - Frame Pointer
* The frame pointer is used by high-level language compilers to track the current stack frame.
* Copy of stack pointer before function stack allocation.

* As far as hardware is concerned, frame pointer is exactly the same as other general-purpose registers, but AARCH64 programmers use it for the frame pointer because of the Application Binary Interface

## R30 - Link Register
The procedure link register is used to hold the return address for subroutines.
* Certain instructions cause the PC to be copied to the link register, then the PC is loaded with a new address.
* Using x30 as a general-purpose register is dangerous and is strongly discouraged.
## PSTATE Register
The PSTATE register is actually a collection of independent fields, most of which are only used by the OS.
* User programs make use of the first four bits: N, Z, C, and V.
* These are referred to as the **condition flags**. Most instructions can modify these flags, and later instructions can use them.
* Instructions such as conditional branches, conditional select, and others use condition codes derived from these four flags.

## Program Counter
The program counter, PC, always contains the address of the next instruction that will be executed.
* Not a general purpose register, cannot be directly referenced
* Processor increments this register by four automatically after each instruction is fetched from memory.
* By moving an address into this register, the programmer can cause the processor to fetch the next instruction from the new address.
* Only a small number of instructions can access the PC directly.
	* Any instructions that create a PC-relative address or load a register (such as adr and ldr) are able to access the PC directly.
	* Branch instructions are able to modify it.
* PC cannot be specified as the destination of a data processing instruction or load instruction.
