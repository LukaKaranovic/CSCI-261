## Multiplication

### Partial Sum Method (Unsigned)
Multiply normally, but add a 0 each time you go over a digit, then add up all the results.
Only works for multiplying unsigned numbers.

### Booth's Multiplication
* Works for signed numbers
* More efficient than partial sums
* However, if multiplier (Q) has alternating 1's and 0's, the performance decreases
	* e.g. Q = 010101010101...

**Here is how Booth's Algorithm works:** 
* Look at decode method 2.

#### Algorithm
Note: you need to find -M before starting to easily do A = A-M.

## Division

### Restoration
* Based on long division
* More complex than multiplication

Quotient is in Q register
Remainder is in A register
