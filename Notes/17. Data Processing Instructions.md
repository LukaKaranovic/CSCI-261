## Learning Objective(s):
Mathematical operations: add, adds, sub, subs, mul, sdiv, udiv, msub  
cmp (especially mnemonics EQ, NE, LE, LT, GT, GE
* which NZCV PSTATE bits are checked for this)

Data processing instructions cannot access memory, only register values or immediate values are used.
* Use load and store to bring data from memory to registers to process them.

Data processing instructions are three address insutrcitons: destination and two operands.
\<operation> \<destination>, \<operand1>, \<operand2>
### Arithmetic
add - Adds two numbers.
adds - Adds two numbers and sets the PSTATE flags on the result.
sub - Subtracts two numbers.
subs - Subtracts two numbers and sets the PSTATE flags on the result.
mul - Multiplies two numbers.
sdiv - Signed division of two numbers (no condition flags affected).
udiv - Unsigned division of two numbers (no condition flags affected).
msub - Multiply-subtract. Multiplies the first two numbers, and subtracts the 3rd from it, stores in destination.

## cmp operation
\<cmp> \<Rn>, \<operand2> does Rn - operand2 and sets PSTATE flags.

| EQ  | equal/zero                   | Z == 1              |
| --- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| NE  | not equal/non-zero           | Z == 0              |
| LE  | signed less than or equal    | Z \== 1 \|\| N != V |
| LT  | signed less than             | N != V              |
| GE  | signed greater than or equal | N == V              |
| GT  | signed greater than          | Z \== 0 && N == V   |
