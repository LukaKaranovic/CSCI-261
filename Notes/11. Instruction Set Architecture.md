## Learning Objective(s):
Difference between RISC and CISC Instruction Architecture

The semantics of all the instructions supported by a processor is known as the instruction set architecture (ISA).  

The instruction set architecture is: 
* The way that software perceives hardware. 
* The list of basic functions that the hardware exports to the external world. 
* A contract between the hardware and software  
## Reduced Instruction Set Computer
* Implements simple instructions that have a simple and regular structure.
* Number of instructions is typically a small number (64 to 128).
* Ex. ARM, IBM PowerPC, HP PA-RISC
## Complex Instruction Set Computer
* Implements complex instructions that are highly irregular, take multiple operands, and implement complex functionalities.
* the number of instructions is large (500+)
* Ex. Intel x86, VAX
