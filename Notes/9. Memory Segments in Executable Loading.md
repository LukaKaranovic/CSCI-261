## Learning Objective(s):
Roles of Text, Data, BSS, Heap, and Stack segments

When a binary executable is loaded in memory for execution, different segments of the code go to predefined different segments of memory.
## Text
**Purpose:** This contains the compiled machine code instructions of the program, such as your functions and methods.  

**Characteristics:** It is typically read-only to prevent accidental modifications during program execution.
## Data and BSS
The data segment is further divided into two sub-segments:  

**Initialized Data Segment:** This holds global and static variables that are explicitly initialized by the programmer (e.g., int x = 10).  

**Uninitialized Data Segment (BSS):** This contains global and static variables that are declared but not initialized (e.g., int y). 
* BSS stands for “Block Started by Symbol"
## Heap
**Purpose:** The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation. Memory allocated using malloc(), calloc(), or new in C/C++ comes from the heap.  
**Characteristics:**
* The heap grows and shrinks as you allocate and deallocate memory during the runtime of your program.  
* The heap is managed manually by the programmer in languages like C/C++ (meaning you need to free the memory when it’s no longer needed using free() or delete).  
* Memory allocation in the heap is **slower compared to stack allocation,** but it provides more flexibility because the size of the memory doesn't need to be known at compile time.  
## Stack
**Purpose:** The stack is used for storing local variables, function call frames, and control flow (like return addresses).  

**Characteristics:** 
* The stack follows a Last In, First Out (LIFO) model, where the most recent function call (or variable declaration) is at the top of the stack.  
* Memory on the stack is automatically managed. When a function returns, all local variables and the function’s frame are popped from the stack.  
* Stack allocation is faster than heap allocation because it’s much simpler in terms of bookkeeping.  
* The stack has a limited size, and if you use too much space (e.g., via deep recursion or large local variables), you can get a stack overflow.
## Summary
Text: code, constant data  
Data: initialized global & static variables  
BSS: uninitialized global & static variables  
Heap: dynamic memory  
Stack: local variables and function calls
