## Learning Objective(s):
Floating Point (UQm.n) and (Qm.n) Representation  
Fixed Point addition, subtraction, and multiplication  
Introduction to IEEE754 Floating Point Representation (including half, single,  
and double precision)  
Encoding and decoding Single Precision IEEE754 values with emphasis on range  
and special numbers
## Fixed Point
Fixed number of digits before and after the decimal point.
UQm.n for unsigned - m bits before point, n bits after point
Qm.n for signed - m+1 its before point (1 for sign), n bits after point.

The position of the point affects the range and precision:
* **range:** difference between the largest and smallest representable numbers.
* **precision:** smallest possible difference between any two numbers.
### Conversions
Convert f = 3.141593 to unsigned fixed point format UQ4.12  
1. Calculate f X 2<sup>12</sup> = 3.141593 X 2<sup>12</sup> = 12867.964928  
2. Round the result to an integer round (12867.964928) = 12868  
3. Convert to binary (12868)<sub>10</sub> = (11001001000100<sub>2</sub>  
4. Organize as UQ4.12 (11.001001000100)<sub>2</sub>
5. Extend if required (0011.001001000100)<sub>2</sub>

Convert f = -3.141593 to signed fixed point format Q3.12  
1. Calculate f X 27.964928 2<sup>12</sup> = -3.141593 X 2<sup>12</sup> = -12867.964928  
2. Round the result to an integer round (-12867.964928) = -12868  
3. Convert to absolute to binary (12868)<sub>10</sub>  = (11001001000100)<sub>2</sub> 
4. Organize as 16 bits (Sign Integer Fraction) 1+3+12, Q3.12 (0011.001001000100)<sub>2</sub>  
5. Find twoâ€™s complement (1100.110110111100)<sub>2</sub>

## IEEE754
* Want to represent floating point numbers kind of like scientific notation (1.2 * 10<sup>6</sup>).
* Get in the form x * 2<sup>y</sup>
* Have half, single, and double precision representations

Always 'normalize' your binary number so that there is a 1 to the left of the point.

Decimal number = (-1)<sup>sign</sup> * (1 + Fraction) * 2<sup>Actual Exponent</sup>


**Bias Constant** - A method of representing signed integers in binary for exponents, so we can have special values (and don't have to use two's comp).
* For single precision, bias constant is 2<sup>7</sup> = 127.
To encode a number: **binary value = actual value + 127**
To decode a number: **actual value = binary value - 127**
## Special Values

If exponent is all zeros, we switch into **'denormalized' mode**.
* Now treat exponent as -126, and the fraction as without the **leading** 1.
* Allows us to represent the smallest numbers as precisely as possible.
* Decimal number = (-1)<sup>sign</sup> * (Fraction) * 2<sup>-126</sup>
