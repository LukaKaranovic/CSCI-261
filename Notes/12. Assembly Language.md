## Learning Objective(s):
Assembly language program structure  
* Directives, comments, mnemonics, labels, sections  
Data Aligning in ARM
## General Structure

**Each assembly statement can consist of three fields:**
* a label (identifier of the instruction)
* the key (an assembly instruction, or directive to assembler)
* a comment

### Directives and Sections:
* Begins with a period
* Rest of name is composed of letters
* Instructs the GNU Assembler during its assembly process on:
	* Controlling the sections  
	* Allocating space for variables and constants  
	* Setting and manipulating symbols  
	* Filling and aligning memory space  
	* Conditional assembly  
	* Defining macros

**Examples (sections):**
.data
.text
.bss
.section

**Examples (directives):**
.word
.asciz
.global *symbol* -> makes symbol visible to the linker
### Comments:
// for single line comment
/* \*/ for multi-line comment
### Mnemonics:
Regular assembly instructions are mnemonics.

**Examples:**
add
mul
ldr
str
adr
### Labels:
A label is a name followed by a colon.
It uniquely identifies a given point or data item in the assembly program.

**Examples:**
main:
function:
end:

## Data Alignment
We have some directives used for allocating space for variables and constants:
.byte (8-bit)
.hword (16-bit)
.word (32-bit)
.quad (64-bit)
.ascii (string with no NULL terminator)
.asciz or .string (string with a NULL terminator)
.float or .single (32-bit single precision floating point numbers)
.double (64-bit double precision floating point numbers)
.space *size* (allocates a size-byte space of memory)

### Aligning:
.align 3, 0 (Advances the location counter until it's a multiple of 8 and if the location counter is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed, If advance is successful, pads the advanced bytes with 0.)

.align 2, 0 (same thing with multiple of 4)

.align 1, 0 (same thing with multiple of 2)

In AArch64 assembly programming, proper data alignment is crucial for performance and correctness.  
**Alignment Requirements:**
* Halfword: Must be aligned to a 2-byte boundary (addresses that are multiples of 2).  
* Word: Must be aligned to a 4-byte boundary (addresses that are multiples of 4).  
* Double Word: Must be aligned to an 8-byte boundary (addresses that are multiples of 8).

Use the .align directive to ensure proper alignment in your assembly code. 

Some processors expect certain data types (like quads that are 8 bytes) to be at addresses that are multiples of 8, words for 4, etc.

If this doesn't happen, may be an alignment fault which may cause your processor to access the wrong bytes.
* Using .align will prevent potential alignment faults and ensure optimal access speed.

To not have to use align, declare your quads first, then words, then halfwords, then bytes, then strings. This way, everything's memory addresses will have the correct multiples.
