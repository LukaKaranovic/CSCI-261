## Register Addressing
LDR X1, \[X0] - load the value from the memory address in X0 into X1
STR X2, \[X3] - store the value from the memory address in X3 into X2
## Immediate Offset Addressing
This mode uses an immediate value as the offset from a base register, does not update any addresses.

LDR X1, \[X0, #16] - Load the value from the memory address X0 + 16 into X1  
STR X2, \[X3, \#-8] - Store the value in X2 to the memory address X3 - 8
## Pre-indexed Addressing
Base register is updated **before** the memory operation by adding the offset, and then the updated value is used to access memory.

Syntax: \[\<register>, \#\<offset>]!

LDR X1, \[X0, #12]! - Add 12 to X0, then load the value from this new address into X1  
STR X2, \[X3, #4]! - Add 4 to X3, then store X2 at this updated address
## Post-indexed Addressing
The memory address is accessed first, and then the base register is updated with the offset after the operation.  

Syntax: \[<base_register>], \#\<offset>

LDR X1, \[X0], #16 - Load from the address in X0 into X1, then add 16 to X0  
STR X1, \[X2], #8 - Store X1 at the address in X2, then add 8 to X2

## Register Offset Addressing
This is a variant of register offset addressing, where the offset register is scaled by the size of the data type being accessed.
* Useful for accessing elements in an array.

Syntax: \[<base_register>, <offset_register>, LSL \#\<shift>| sxtx] (signed extension)

LDR X1, \[X0, X2, LSL #3] ; Load from the address X0 + (X2 << 3) into X1 (useful for 64-bit data)  
STR X1, \[X3, X4, LSL #2] ; Store X1 at the address X3 + (X4 << 2) (useful for 32-bit data)  
LDR w1, \[x2, w3, sxtw] //sign extend w3 to fill as X3 and add to x2 to get new address  
LDR w1, \[x2, w3, uxtw] //zero extend w3 to fill as X3 and add to x2 to get new address
## Literal Addressing
This mode is used for loading data directly from a fixed address (relative to the current PC).
An address within +- 1 MB of program counter can be calculated.

Syntax: Load LDR X0, \<label>
* Loads value at label
* Like LDR X1, y
