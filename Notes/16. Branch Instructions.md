## Learning Objective(s):
Conditional branch instructions (cbz, tst)  
Unconditional branch instructions (b, bl)

## Unconditional Branch
b \<label> - unconditional branch is always taken, and goes to the label specified.
* PC is set to the target address specified by label.

bl (branch with link) - instruction is used to branch to a target address and simultaneously store the return address (i.e., the address of the next instruction) in the link register.
* Commonly used for calling subroutines or functions.
* PC is set to the target address specified by label.
* Return address (i.e., PC + 4) is stored in the LR, so that after completing subroutine, the program can return to where it left off by branching to the address in LR.

## Conditional Branch
Most conditional branches test the result of a previous comparison or arithmetic instruction (like cmp, tst, subs), which update these flags (in PSTATE).

cbz - compare and branch if zero
cbnz - compare and branch if not zero
tbz - test bit and branch if zero
tbnz - test bit and branch if not zero

Can use cmp on two registers/values and then do:
beq - branch if equal
bne - branch if not equal
blt - branch if less than
etc.
