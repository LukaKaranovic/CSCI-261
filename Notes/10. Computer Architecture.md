## Inside the CPU
**Registers:** 
* These are small, high-speed storage locations directly within a computer's CPU.
* Used to store and quickly access data that the CPU needs during the execution of instructions.
* Act as a temporary holding place for data that the CPU is actively working with, minimizing the need to access RAM for frequent operations.
**Control Unit:**
* Does a simple cycle: **Fetch, Decode, Execute**
1. Fetch - Ask the RAM for the instruction whose address is stored in PC.
2. Decode - Identify what to do (from instruction set).
3. Execute - Depending on what instruction is, do what is necessary to execute it.
4. Repeat - Add 4 to the address stored in PC, go back to step 1.
**Memory Unit/RAM:**
* If a program is stored in RAM, that means that a sequence of instructions are stored in consecutively address bytes in the RAM.
* Data values (variables) are stored anywhere in RAM.
* Both instructions and data are accessed from RAM using addresses
* RAM is a crucial part of the computer's overall architecture.
**The Bus:**
* Simplified way for many devices to communicate to each other.
* Looks like a 'highway' for information.
* Many different buses, they are a **group of electrical wires that are used to transmit similar information.**
	* System bus
	* Address bus
	* Data bus
	* Control bus
**How they all communicate:**
* Computer has many parts, connected by a bus.
* The RAM is the computer's main memory, this is where programs and data are stored.
* The CPU goes in a never-ending cycle, reading instructions from RAM and executing them.
	* This cycle is orchestrated by the Control Unit in the CPU.
	* It looks at where PC is pointing, reads instruction from RAM, executes it.
* To execute an instruction, the Control Unit uses the ALU and memory/registers.
## Von Neumann Architecture
Von Neumann computer systems contain three main building blocks:
1. The central processing unit (CPU)
2. Memory
3. Input/output devices (I/O)
These three components are interconnected using the system bus(es).

**Key Concepts:**
1. Stored Program Concept: Programs (instructions) and data are both located in the same memory.
2. It follows the fetch, decode, execute cycle (needs at least 2 cycles to execute because instruction and data need to be fetched, can only do one at a time).

**Set of registers:**
* memory buffer register
* memory address register
* instruction register
* instruction buffer register
* program counter
* accumulator
* multiplier/quotient
## Harvard Architecture
Harvard Architecture is the design which modern microcontrollers are computer chips are designed after.

Harvard architecture processors or microcontroller systems contain the following building blocks:
1. The CPU
2. Data memory
3. Instruction memory
4. Input/output Devices (I/O)

**Key Concepts:**
1. Programs (instructions) and data are kept in separate memory blocks.
2. Processor accesses the memory using separate data and address buses
3. It also follows the fetch, decode, execute cycle (needs 1 cycle to execute).
## Von Neumann vs. Harvard

### Von Neumann Pros and Cons
**Advantages:**  
* Simplicity: The design is straightforward and easier to implement.  
* Flexibility: Programs can be modified by changing the contents of memory, which makes this architecture adaptable to different tasks and easier to reprogram.  
* Reduced Cost: Since both instructions and data share the same memory, this reduces hardware complexity compared to separate memories for instructions and data.  
**Disadvantages:**  
* Memory Bottleneck: Because instructions and data share the same bus and memory, only one memory operation (fetching instructions or reading/writing data) can occur at a time. This can slow down the system, especially with faster CPUs needing to wait for slower memory accesses.  
* Security Concerns: Since instructions and data share the same space, malicious software could overwrite instructions and manipulate program flow (e.g., buffer overflow attacks).

### Harvard Pros and Cons
**Advantages:**
* Simultaneous Access: The CPU can fetch instructions and data simultaneously, which increases processing speed.  
* Higher Throughput: By separating instruction and data memory, the architecture avoids the Von Neumann bottleneck, leading to potentially higher data throughput.  
* Improved Security: With separate instruction and data spaces, malicious modification of instructions by corrupted data is less likely.  
**Disadvantages:**
* Increased Complexity: Having separate buses and memory for instructions and data adds complexity to the hardware design.  
* Less Flexibility: In pure Harvard architecture, the division between instruction and data memory is rigid. Memory allocated for instructions cannot be used for data storage and vice versa, potentially leading to inefficient use of resources.  
* Cost: The need for separate memory and buses makes the architecture more expensive to implement, especially in earlier systems.

### The main difference
In Von Neumann, instruction and data are stored in the same physical memory location.
* There is only one bus transmitting this information to the CPU.
* The Control Unit needs two clock cycles to execute an instruction.
In Harvard, instruction and data are stored in separate memory locations.
* There is a data bus and an address bus for each type.
* The Control Unit needs one clock cycle to execute an instruction, as data transfers and instruction fetches can be performed at the same time.

Harvard is much more complex, adding to the development cost. 
Harvard has limited flexibility as there is only a certain amount of memory that can be used for data, and a certain amount for instruction.
Harvard does solve the memory bottleneck problem Von Neumann has, improving processing speed.
