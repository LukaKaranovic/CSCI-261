## Learning Objective(s):
Conversions between Decimal, Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal, and other given  
radices
## Conversions from decimal to other
An N-digit number of radix R has R<sup>n</sup> possibilities, max value is R<sup>n</sup>-1

1. Take a decimal number and divide it by the radix
2. Add the remainder to the start of the result number
3. repeat until the decimal number is 0.

E.g. Convert (314)<sub>10</sub> to octal:
314 / 8 = 39, remainder 2
39 / 8 = 4, remainder 7
4 / 8 = 0, remainder 4
Answer is (274)<sub>8</sub>. 
## Conversions from other to decimal
1. Initialize a decimal number to 0, and a power to 0.
2. Start from the right, decimalnumber += digit * radix<sup>power</sup> 
3. Add one to power each digit.

E.,g. Convert (86B)<sub>16</sub> to decimal:
decNum = 0
B = 11, 0 + 11 * 16<sup>0</sup> = 11
11 + 6 * 16<sup>1</sup> = 105
105 += 8 * 16<sup>2</sup> = 2048
2048 + 105 = 2153.
Amswer is (2153)<sub>10</sub>.
